Made to run 24/7, this bot generates questions about Dota 2, in a way which discourages users googling questions.

Music is always playing. The questions/answer cards are generated, and Twitch viewers have a limited time to answer. Winners get points. Points can be spent to add new music, skip the current song, or instantly play a song.

The dream was that Dota professionals would influence music that Dota players want to listen to, and it would become a go-to source for background music while playing Dota. It was a fun learning experience. A lot of people utilized all the features which made me happy! 
But it's not worth the electricity or hardware, so I gave it up!

There are a lot of dependencies that are not documented or uploaded to GitHub. (OBS overlay, images, databases) However I encourage you to examine: 
	how the cards are written starting @ line 868
	how the live chat is interpreted @ line 1742
