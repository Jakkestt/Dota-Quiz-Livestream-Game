Music to Play Dota To

An automated video livestream which gave users points for difficult Dota 2 questions. Users spent points to play specific songs, or vote down songs. The favorites are played 24/7. Since Dota experts are the only users with points, the stream becomes and is called "Music to Play Dota 2".

Difficulty is created by generating multiple choices that are similar to the answer. This and question design discourage Google cheating. 


After a few days, the Twitch stream gained 70 followers. People in Twitch Chat gained points for answering questions, then changed the music with their points. 

The code is in minimum viable project form. And some dependencies are not uploaded to GitHub. (OBS overlay, images, databases) However I encourage you to examine: 
	how the cards are written starting @ line 868
	how the live chat is interpreted @ line 1742
